## Pull requests

* Submit early and often. 
* The point of pull requests is not to prove you did the work, but to get input from others.
* Submitting non-functioning code to get help is a valid strategy.
* Coding isn't something to leave to the last minute.
* Revise and submit again.

* Working together is an important skill for a developer.
