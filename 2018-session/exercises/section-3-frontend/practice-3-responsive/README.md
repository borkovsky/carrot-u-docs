# Practice #3 - Make the site responsive

## Goal
The purpose of this exercise is to practice media queries and responsive layouts.
Typically you would want to design and create responsive layouts first; however,
we have worked backwards in order to demonstrate the difficulties and decisions that
need to be made to refactor a site to be responsive after a desktop version exist.

## Instructions
1. Begin with the site you created in practice #2
2. Adjust the browser size to see how your site looks at various sizes.
3. Find break points in which the font, image or overall layout starts to look
off or ugly (i.e. ~1180px the header text starts to bunch up, or the card
doesn't have enough room)
4. Establish 3-4 break points where your styles should change to fix the screen size.
5. Add media queries into your style sheet to adjust styles. See [this page](https://www.w3schools.com/Css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp) for reference.
6. Use the chrome developer tools to test out what the site would look like on
various phones. See [this guide](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/device-mode/)
7. Look at the style.css file in the solutions folder for one possible implementation.
