# Practice #2 - Add some CSS

## Purpose
The goal of this exercise is to practice styling and refactoring a static HTML
site to be more visually appealing site using CSS.

## Instructions
1.  Start by looking at the sample solutions for inspiration and direction:
    - [Ramen](https://carrot-u-exercises.herokuapp.com/solutions/best-ramen.html)
    - [Sushi](https://carrot-u-exercises.herokuapp.com/solutions/best-sushi.html)
    - [Curry](https://carrot-u-exercises.herokuapp.com/solutions/best-curry.html)
2. Style your own site created in exercise #1 similar to the site above. The your version
doesn't have to be the same (but can be if you are feeling uninspired), but you should
perform the following:
    - Import a new font (https://fonts.google.com/)
    - Create a hero banner with a background image
    - Create a navigation bar with links to other pages
    - Stylize each list item with standardized classes this can include:
      - standard image size
      - header font-size, color and weight
      - control link hover, color and active
3. Check your finished product against the sample solutions to see other ways to
implement.

## Reach Goal
Move on to exercise #3, which will take the styling and makes it responsive to multiple
screen sizes and mobile devices. This is totally optional, but if you feel like
giving it a go, check out exercise #3.

## Bonus point
Put your styled site up on heroku. **hint:** Heroku isn't friendly to static HTML
sites, so you will need to give it a base index file in a format heroku knowns what to do with.
