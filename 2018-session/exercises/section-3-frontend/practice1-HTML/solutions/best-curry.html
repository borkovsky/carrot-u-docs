          This SoMa joint doesn't specialize in Japanese food, but Asian Fusion.
          That doesn't stop it from having one of the best katsu curries in town.
          Seating is limited, but there is a park near by that is a great place
          to eat and relax.

          Does let the strange Yoshyoku (Japanese version of western food) menu
          scare you away. The food is really good and the curry can be made any
          way you like it with extra veggies or spice!
