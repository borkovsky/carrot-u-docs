# Practice #1 - HTML only

## Purpose
The goal of this exercise is to provide students with practice building a website
using common html tags. Students will gain an understanding of the importance
of styling, as html alone is not very pretty. In practice #2, student will get the
opportunity to modify the site using CSS to improve on the look and feel.

## Instructions
1.  Start by opening the PDFs listed below to see an example website you are going to build (there are no styles yet so its kind of an eye-sore).
   - Japanese Food SF - Sushi.pdf
   - Japanese Food SF - Ramen.pdf
   - Japanese Food SF - Curry.pdf
2. Create a website using the standard html tags (head, body, etc...) and any other tags you believe you will need replicate the pdf. 
3. Feel free to change the content. Descriptions, image, etc... its up to you. Pictures are provided in the `/images` folder, if you want to make use of the same images as the example PDFs. You can make a completely different type of website if you want. The goal is to practice the html building blocks.
4. Check the solution folder for possible solutions (don't worry if the specific tags and ordering in yours is different as long as the end result is similar)
5. Move on to practice #2!
