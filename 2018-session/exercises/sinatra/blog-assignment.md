## Assignment submission process

- Create a Github repo in your personal Github account for your project (If you need help on how to do this, check out this page: https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/)


- Create a new branch of the [assignments repo](https://github.com/carrot-u/assignments)
- Add a link to your Github repo for your project to [this file](https://github.com/carrot-u/assignments/blob/master/week8/blogs.md).
- Submit a PR for your branch.

## Instructions

From this [week's lecture](https://github.com/carrot-u/carrot-u-docs/blob/master/docs/sinatra/notes.md), you should have a minimal [working blog](https://github.com/carrot-u/carrot-u-docs/tree/master/docs/sinatra/live). Go back and review the notes if you need to brush up on anything from the lecture.

Now expand the functionality of this blog. This is a somewhat open ended assignment, but here are some ideas for things to do:

- display the 10 most recent blog posts
- create an archive or calendar for all blog posts
- use ERB layouts to add elements that are displayed on all pages (hint: layouts are discussed here: http://sinatrarb.com/intro.html)
- make the blog look better with CSS and images
- add comments to blog posts
- add the concept of post authors
- display the "created_at" date in a nicer way
- allow editing of blog posts
- ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT TO TRY!

Some of these will require more work than others. Start small, but challenge yourself!
