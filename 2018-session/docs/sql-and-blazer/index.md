# Why SQL?

A web site or application consists of three main pieces

1. The HTML and any supporting code that are executed by the browser to display the site
1. The web server which delivers that content upon request by a browser
1. The data that is stored and retrieved to customize the content of the site

Traditionally, this is the order in which these concepts are taught.

We're starting with an introduction to SQL and databases because we have a great tool in 
[Blazer](https://blazer.instacart.com/)
and a wealth of data for you to practice on. You've probably already used it pretty extensively.
This means that you can get a "quick win" by learning SQL, and we can start giving you some 
insight into how Instacart works. 

Beyond that, a website or application of any depth at all is nothing without the data to back it up;
from a software engineering standpoint, this is the order in which we usually address the
development of a new feature.
