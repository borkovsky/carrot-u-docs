# Install Git
## Why?
Any serious software project requires version control. Version control allows you to make changes to
code in a controlled manner because it keeps track of previous versions, so if you make a serious error
you can simply revert to a previous version without the error.

It is also great for collaborating on software with other people,
as it detects conflicts in changes and allows you to resolve them without
trampling on someone else's changes.
 
[git](https://git-scm.com/) is the most popular open-source source control system, by a huge margin, so it is likely that
anywhere you go they will use git.

## How?

As (almost) always, brew!

    % brew install git
