These instructions assume that you will be using a Mac with an OSX version 
later than Snow Leopard. If that is not the case, please reach out to someone
in the #carrot-university Slack channel or talk with a mentor at
office hours.

We want to get you out of the Treehouse sandbox and into the real world
as soon as possible. That said, you won't use some of these tools right away.
However, they will be there for you when you reach a point in the content
where you want to try things out.
