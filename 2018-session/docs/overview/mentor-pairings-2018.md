# Carrot U 2018 Mentor Pairings

While you should feel free to reach out to any of the Carrot U mentors, each student has been paired up with a 1:1 mentor.

You and your mentor should meet (in person, over video chat, whatever works best for you) once a week to do a quick checkin.

Let your mentor know how you're doing. What you're enjoying. What you're struggling with. Ask them about their experiences as engineers.

## Pairings

| Student | Mentor |
| --- | --- |
| Seth Bertenthal | Tore Eschliman |
| Marlon Del Cid | Jeremy Flanagan |
| Fernando Elvira | Pedro Assis |
| Michael Prescott | Viktor Evdokimov |
| Kenneth Weed | Logan Murdock |
| Alex Wong | Daniel Bechard |
| Matt Goff | Nicolas Bancel |
| Mamata Malekoo | James Jalandoni |

Dave and Muffy are "subs" so if your mentor is out of town or busy you might meet with one of them.
