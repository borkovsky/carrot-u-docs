# Learning 101

## What is Learning?

### Immersion

How do you become fluent in another language? The proven best way is immersion. You live in the culture and are forced to speak and listen to the language all day, every day. Programming is a language. Music is a language. Even fitness is a language. Despite myriad differences among pedagogues, they all agree that regular and consistent practice is the best way to learn and retain.

### How Does Your Brain Learn Stuff?

Cognition is essentially muscle memory. Your brain cells, nerves, and synapses learn by what you do. Cramming is bad, not because you can't pass the test, but because you lose it once you don't need it. This is how learning works:

  + When you learn a new thing (whether it's motor or cerebral), your brain retains it for about 20 minutes.
  + After 20 minutes, your brain decided whether to move it temp/permanent storage or trash it.
  + Through repetition, both immediate and overtime, your brain moves more of that information to permanent storage.

[_Revelant tangent: In some ways, this process is similar to how actual computer RAM works._](https://computer.howstuffworks.com/ram.htm)

### Tips to Improve Retention

  * Do the same [small] thing 12 times consecutively and consistently to train your brain, but make sure you don't do it incorrectly. Practice makes permanent.
  * Review the week's previous lessons for a few minutes each day before pushing forward.
  * Put the time in every day, even if life gets in the way and you can only squeeze in 20 minutes.

## Set a Regular Schedule
  * Schedules generally increase personal accountability.
  * Be loose at first and then set regular times once you find your groove.
  * Allow for flexibility and unexpected time sucks (commute, sickness, meetings, LIFE)
  * Allow for some time every week to have fun or just decompress. Studies show that both sleep and extracurricular coginitive/sensory stimuation (reading, board games, dance party) can improve retention and comprehension.

### Sample Schedule
#### Weekday
  + 8 -9 AM Coursework/Project _(Usually review previous material here)_
  + 9 AM Office hours if available
  + 12 PM Coursework/Project OR Office Hours
  + 4 PM Coursework/Project (if regular work is done)
  + 6 - 7 PM Coursework/Project
  + 8 - 10 PM Gym
  + 10 -11 PM Coursework/Project

#### Weekend
  + 8 AM - noon Coursework/Project
  + noon - 2 Gym
  + 2 -6 PM Coursework/Project

## Tools and Helpers
### Setup Your Home Environment
  * If you can, designate a work space for study and practice. This will help create a focused environment.
  * That said, don't be afraid to use the comforts of a couch or bed to change things up a bit
  * Invest in a computer monitor
  * Make sure you have a computer charger available!

### Break Up The Sessions
  * Break up the type of study into Coursework, Reading, and Projects
  * Use a timer
  * Every 20 minutes take a minute to reset your brain
  * Every 40 - 60 minutes, switch gears

### Tell your programmer friends what you're working on
  * They might have some awesome resources.
  * It's good practice to explain what you're learning to someone else
  * Beware the tech gear bro

### Pair up with other students to solve assignments
  * Gain new perspectives
  * Share the load
  * Make new friends


## Shallow Spelunking
Treehouse, written materials, and instructors will always give you "additional reading". Go forth and explore, but not too far from the path. Reading 1 or 2 other related items can help reinforce concepts. This is great, but don't derail. Make sure to come back to the original material and ensure that the additional information helped.

* Save longer or less relevant reading for your commute, or designated reading time.
* Don't believe the first thing you read. Anyone can post on the internet... ANYONE!

## Competitive Edge

  Were you the kid who always had to finish their test first? Were you first chair in band? Did you have to run faster than everyone else in gym class? Treehouse shows you other team's progress. Use this to your advantage. If you're not super competitive, use it as a gauge to see if you are keeping up.

## Self Assessment
  The cognitive domain list of [Bloom's Taxonomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom%27s_taxonomy#The_cognitive_domain_(knowledge-based)) is a heirarchy used in pedagogy to help teachers design curricula and assessments.

  Use this to gauge how well you understand the material. We'll be sending out self-assessement and general feedback forms every so often that use this scale.

  + **Knowledge:** I can recite most of terms and ideas discussed.
  + **Comprehension:** I can describe the concept in my own words.
  + **Application:** I can write a single piece of code using the concepts presented.
  + **Analysis:** I can examine code that demonstrates this concept and explain the logic in my own words.
  + **Synthesis:** I can write a functional program that integrates, but does not solely rely on, this concept.
  + **Evaluation:** I can write a blog post or teach a lecture about this concept to other novice programmers.

## Final Word

Think of this as a precious opportunity, a free bootcamp, a wonderful open door to learning a new a skill, and quite possibly a new career. At the very least, Carrot U will give you a refreshing plethora of intellectual stimulation.
