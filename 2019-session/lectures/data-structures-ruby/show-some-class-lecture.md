# Show Some Class: Objects and Classes In Ruby

## Overview
- We're going to talk about classes and objects (specifically implemented in Ruby)
- This lecture involves live coding which means I will misspell things
- Pull out a laptop and a text editor and code along with the examples!
- Seriously, code along
- For some reason many of my examples are cat related. I'm not sure why.
  - This is my cat [Chairman Meow](https://www.instagram.com/p/6GfLXChWT4/)

## Key Terms
- data structure
- class
- object

## Data Structures You've Already Been Using

### Arrays
```ruby
dave = ["Dave", 35, true, "üçï"]
dave.include?("üçï")
# true

names = ["Dave", "Muffy", "Chairman Meow"]
names << "Bender"
# ["Dave", "Muffy", "Chairman Meow", "Bender"]
names.sort
# ["Bender", "Chairman Meow", "Dave", "Muffy"]
names.size
# 4
```

### Hashes
```ruby
number_of_cats_owned = {
  dave: 1,
  muffy: 3,
  jeremy: 1
}
number_of_cats_owned[:dave]
# 1
number_of_cats_owned.each do |key, value|
  puts "#{key.to_s.capitalize} has #{value} cat(s)."
end

chairman = {
  animal_type: "cat",
  number_of_legs: 4,
  name: "Chairman Meow"
}

trex = {
  animal_type: "dinosaur",
  number_of_legs: 2,
  name: "Rex"
}

chairman[:name]
# "Chairman Meow"
```
## Ok. So What is a data structure?

A **data structure** is a data organization format. It a collection of data values and the relationship among them.

## What is a class? (And what is an object?)

A class is a template or blueprint for objects. It describes what and object is and can do.

This means defining what values it can have and what methods it has. Values are accessed by methods (I'll explain what that means later).

The `Array` class has `sort` and `size` method.

An object is an **instance** of a class. You **instantiate** a class and get an object.

Animals have a type, a name, some number of legs, a favorite food, and they can eat!

## How do classes relate to data structures?

Classes are user defined, special purpose data structures

_(note: how data structures and classes/objects relate to each other could be discussed in further academic detail, but this definition is a good starting place.)_

## Ok. Let's make a class

_This means you! Pull out a laptop and make this class!_

```ruby
class Animal

  def initialize(type_of_animal, name, number_of_legs, favorite_food)
    @type = type_of_animal
    @name = name
    @number_of_legs = number_of_legs
    @favorite_food = favorite_food
  end
end
```

## Now let's use it!

```ruby
chairman = Animal.new("cat", "Chairman Meow", 4, "ham")
```

## Inheritance

A cat is an animal.
A dinosaur is an animal.
A octopus is an animal.

An octopus can spray ink. A cat cannot (to the best of my knowledge).

**Inheritance** allows classes to take on the properties of other classes. The class that is being inhertited from is called the **parent class** or **base class**.

Ruby has **single inheritance**, which means a class can only have 1 parent.

```ruby
# code here
```
## Ruby Standad Library Classes

The data structures in the Ruby standard library are implemented with classes. You can look at these definitions by looking at the Ruby source code.

The data structures in the Ruby standard library are implemented with classes. You can look at these definitions by looking at the Ruby source code.

### Example: Set

https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/trunk/lib/set.rb

```ruby
unique_words = Set.new
unique_words << "rectangle"
unique_words << "America"
unique_words << "megaphone"
unique_words << "rectangle"

puts unique_words
# ["rectangle", "America", "megaphone"]
```

## Bringing It Together

**Classes** describe **data structures**. **Objects** are instances of those classes.

## But Why?

Classes and objects make code more **maintainable** and **reusable** and often easier to reason about.

- the interface (the methods made available) to an object can be well understood and hide the implementation details, making it easier to reason about how a program works

## Neat Ruby Things

- `thing.class`
- `thing.class.superclass`
- `thing.methods`
- `thing.public_methods`
- `thing.class.methods`
- Monkey Patching

## Getting Started on a NEW Mini Instacart

```ruby
class Customer
  def initialize()
    @orders = []
  end
end

class Order

end
```
