# InstallFest

These instructions assume that you will be using a Mac with OSX Mojave
or a later version. There are also instructions for machines running
[Windows 10](windows10.md). If you don't have either of these, please
reach out to someone in the #carrot-university Slack channel or talk with
your mentor.

We want to get you out of the Treehouse sandbox and into the real world
as soon as possible. That said, you won't use some of these tools right away.
However, they will be there for you when you reach a point in the content
where you want to try things out.
