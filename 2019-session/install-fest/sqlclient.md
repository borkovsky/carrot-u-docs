# Install a Local SQL Client
## Why?
The command line for Postgres is not terribly friendly, and there's no reason to suffer.
An SQL client will allow you to store and edit queries you have run before, give you a GUI
(graphical user interface, as opposed to CLI) for many common database operations, and will
generally provide helpful validations and instructions.

Note that you should practice in the CLI as well as the GUI, because GUIs tend to mask certain 
functionality in order to be helpful to you. This is nice, but it's also nice to get a look
under the hood.

## How?
