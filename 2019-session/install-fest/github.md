# Create a GitHub Account
## Why?
We'll be using GitHub (https://github.com/) to share course work. It is the most popular public code-sharing
and collaboration site, and many employers want to look at your GitHub account to see your work.

## How?
1. Visit [github.com](https://github.com/) and follow the instructions there for creating an account.<br/>

2. Once you have created your account, request membership in the [carrot-u organization](https://github.com/carrot-u).
This will give you access to our documentation, class assignments, and class project.
Put your github username in the #carrot-university Slack channel and one of the mentors will add you to
the group.
3. Set up [two factor authentication for your github profile](https://github.com/settings/security).
