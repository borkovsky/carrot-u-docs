# Build a Better Blog

## Instructions

From this, you should have a minimal. Go back and review the notes if you need to brush up on anything from the lecture.

Now expand the functionality of this blog. This is a somewhat open ended assignment, but here are some ideas for things to do:

- display the 10 most recent blog posts
- create an archive or calendar for all blog posts
- use ERB layouts to add elements that are displayed on all pages (hint: layouts are discussed here: http://sinatrarb.com/intro.html)
- make the blog look better with CSS and images
- add comments to blog posts
- add the concept of post authors
- display the "created_at" date in a nicer way
- allow editing of blog posts
- ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT TO TRY!

Some of these will require more work than others. Start small, but challenge yourself!
