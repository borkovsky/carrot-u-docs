# Homework: Build a website

Your assignment this week is to create your own website,
using [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Follow the instructions there to create a repository for your user.
For example:
 
* https://github.com/muffy/muffy.github.io
* https://muffy.github.io/

Now that you have created the repository, go ahead and create a website 
for yourself. You can include anything you like, but remember that it is
public, so don't include information you're not comfortable with other
people seeing.

The site should have at minimum:

* An image
* Some styling
  * ideally using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
  * free [bootstrap templates](https://startbootstrap.com/template-categories/all/) to try
* A link to another site

Since you'll be submitting most of your work there, please add a link to
your site to [Personal Sites](https://github.com/carrot-u/assignments-2019/blob/master/assignment-5-website/personal_sites.md)
