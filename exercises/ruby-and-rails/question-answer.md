## Instructions

Create a question and answer site using Rails.

For an example of how your site should work, check out [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) (infact, just get used to checking out Stack Overflow a lot for answers to your own questions).

Your site should at least have basic features like:
- users
- questions (that are associated with users)
- answers (that are associated with questions and users)
- comments (that are associated with questions or answers and users, hint: https://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html#polymorphic-associations ) 
- validations on all of your models

Extra things you can add:
- tags
- up/down votes for questions/answers
- question view counts
- basic search
